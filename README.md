# Kalman-Filters

This repository contains the C++ code for the 1-D and 2-D Kalman filters. The sensor measurements and the motion model for the 1-D Kalman filter are taken as approriate values for the robot moving in the X direction. For the case of 2-D Kalman filter, a state space model is taken along with only position values being measured by the sensors.
